## What does 503 Service Unavailable mean?

The `503 Service Unavailable` response code means that the server is currently not ready to handle the request. This is a common occurrence when the server is down for maintenance or is overloaded.

When looking at things SEO-wise the 503 Service Unavailable status code means that the server is unavailable and the visitor, bot or human, is asked to return again at a later time. This could be because of either server maintenance or server overload and search engines know to come back and check the availability later.

## Parameters

- `message` [optional]: The representative message for this error.
- `details` [optional]: A detailed message of this error.

## Example

```javascript
import { ServiceUnavailable } from 'custom-error-service';
import express from 'express';

const app = express();

app.get('/service-unavailable', (request, response) => {
  // Throw a new ServiceUnavailable error with default parameters
  throw new ServiceUnavailable();
});
```
