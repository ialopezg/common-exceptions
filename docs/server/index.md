## What does a 5xx Server error mean?

A 5xx Server error status code means that while the request appears to be valid, the server could not complete the request. If you're experiencing 5xx server errors for your website, you should immediately look at your server. If you're hosting your own server you'll need to start debugging to figure out why it is not responding properly. If you're using an external hosting provider you'll need to reach out to them, so they can look at it.
