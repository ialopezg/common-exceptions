## What does a 4xx Client Error mean?

A 4xx Client Error status code means that the website or the page could not be reached and either the page is unavailable or the request contains bad syntax. As a website owner you should do your best to avoid these, as it means your users will not find what they're looking for. This can be either pages that are no longer found and are either temporarily or permanently gone. Besides giving a bad user experience, it can also hurt your SEO efforts.
